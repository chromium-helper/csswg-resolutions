### CSSWG Resolutions

This repo tracks CSSWG resolutions by filing separate issues any time a resolution is recorded.

These are meant to be triaged by the Chromium team to see which resolutions require implementation changes (i.e. we need to file a bug).

#### Issues

Issues are automatically filed in response to CSSWG resolutions. If you found a bug and want to file an issue with the bot or the process itself, feel free to do so. Add a `meta` tag if you have permission to do that.

#### Triaging

When triaging an issue that was filed automatically, you can make one of two actions:

1. Close the issue -- this indicates that no further work is required
2. Label the issue with one of `crbug:*` labels. The bot will file a crbug with the given component, and close the issue for you.

Currently there is no way to apply multiple components to an issue via this triage process. We're happy to hear suggestions on how to do this.
